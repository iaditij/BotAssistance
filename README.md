# BotAssistance

As mentioned in the task I could not use Rasa framework 1.9.3 due to issues in my anaconda, there was continous errors due to dependancies. I had tried debugging it for long then proceeded with version 2.0
As mentioned I have used the slots such as phone numbers,name, email address, intents, utterance forms etc

Challenges faced:
After debugging I could train my Rasa model with used slots intents and utterances.
As my rasa environment crashed suddenly and it could not proceed with the connectors

I am still working and hoping to get the bot connected to a connector soon.
