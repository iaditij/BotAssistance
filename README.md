# BotAssistance

As mentioned in the task I could not use Rasa framework 1.9.3 due to issues in my anaconda, there was continous errors due to dependancies. I had tried debugging it for long then proceeded with version 2.0
As mentioned I have used the slots such as phone numbers,name, email address, intents, utterance forms etc

Challenges faced:
while converting data/nlu.yml to nlu.md i faced a major challenge in the domain file due to the data types of phone number and email address with the constant error giving as data is not a dict. Since i had earlier worked with only text slots and intents this was a major hurdle but i tried debugging it and couldnt get a desired result.
Due to this I could not proceed with the connectors as my rasa environment crashed suddenly and it could not run the files runned.

I am still debugging and hoping to get my desired bot soon.
